# WAFGenius v2 Deployment Guide

## 📋 Prerequisites for Deployment

### Required Software
- **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher
- **npm**: Version 8.0.0 or higher (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

### Required Files
- **GeoLite2-City.mmdb**: MaxMind geolocation database (~59MB)
  - Download from: https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data
  - Must be placed in the project root directory
  - Required for IP geolocation functionality

### System Requirements
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB free space (includes Node.js dependencies)
- **Network**: Internet connection for initial setup only

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Project Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd wafgeniusv2

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Verify GeoLite2 database is present
ls -la GeoLite2-City.mmdb
```

### 2. Development Testing
```bash
# Run in development mode
npm run electron:dev
```

### 3. Production Build
```bash
# Clean and build for distribution
./prepare-dist.sh
```

### 4. Manual Build (Alternative)
```bash
# Clean previous builds
npm run clean

# Build React application
npm run build

# Create platform-specific packages
npm run dist
```

## 📦 Distribution Packages

### Automated Build Script
The `prepare-dist.sh` script handles the complete build process:
- Validates GeoLite2 database presence
- Cleans previous builds
- Installs/updates dependencies
- Runs code quality checks
- Builds the React application
- Creates Electron distribution packages

### Manual Build Process
If you prefer manual control:

1. **Clean Environment**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist release node_modules/.cache
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build React App**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Create Distribution**:
   ```bash
   npm run dist        # Current platform only
   npm run dist:all    # All platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux)
   ```

## 🖥️ Platform-Specific Builds

### macOS
- **Output**: `release/WAFGenius v2-2.0.0.dmg`
- **Requirements**: macOS 10.14 or later
- **Installation**: Double-click DMG and drag to Applications

### Windows
- **Output**: `release/WAFGenius v2 Setup 2.0.0.exe`
- **Requirements**: Windows 10 or later
- **Installation**: Run the installer with administrator privileges

### Linux
- **Output**: `release/WAFGenius v2-2.0.0.AppImage`
- **Requirements**: Ubuntu 18.04+ or equivalent
- **Installation**: Make executable and run directly

## 🧪 Testing Deployment

### Pre-deployment Testing
1. **Unit Tests**: Run `npm run lint` for code quality
2. **Integration Test**: Load sample WAF log files
3. **Functionality Test**: Verify geolocation and visualization features

### Sample Test Data
The project includes test data files:
- `waf_logs_from_async_apigw_attack_final.json`: API Gateway attacks
- `extended_russian_ddos_waf_logs_no_location_2025.json`: DDoS patterns

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] GeoLite2 database loads successfully  
- [ ] Sample log files parse correctly
- [ ] Geolocation data displays properly
- [ ] Charts and visualizations render
- [ ] Export functionality works
- [ ] Application can be closed cleanly

## 🔧 Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables
No environment variables required - the application is fully self-contained.

### Configuration Files
- `package.json`: Application metadata and build configuration
- `electron/main.cjs`: Electron main process configuration
- `vite.config.ts`: Build system configuration

### Database Configuration
The GeoLite2 database path is hardcoded to the project root. To change:
1. Edit `electron/main.cjs`
2. Update the database path in the `setupGeoIP` function
3. Rebuild the application

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting Deployment

### Common Issues

#### "GeoLite2 database not found"
- **Cause**: Missing or misnamed database file
- **Solution**: Ensure `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` is in project root
- **Verification**: `ls -la GeoLite2-City.mmdb`

#### "Electron failed to start"
- **Cause**: Port conflicts or missing dependencies
- **Solution**: Check port 8082/8083 availability
- **Alternative**: Run `npm run clean && npm install`

#### "Build fails with permissions error"
- **Cause**: Insufficient file system permissions
- **Solution**: Run with appropriate permissions
- **macOS/Linux**: May need `sudo` for system directories

#### "Application won't start on target machine"
- **Cause**: Missing system dependencies
- **Solution**: Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (Windows)
- **Linux**: Install required system libraries

### Performance Issues
- **Large log files**: Application may be slow with files >50MB
- **Memory usage**: Monitor RAM usage with very large datasets
- **UI responsiveness**: Close other applications if UI becomes sluggish

## 📊 Monitoring Deployment

### Success Metrics
- Application starts within 10 seconds
- Log parsing completes within reasonable time (1MB/second typical)
- Memory usage stays under 1GB for typical workloads
- No JavaScript errors in console

### Logging
- Application logs are written to the console (development)
- Production builds include error logging
- Check Electron developer tools for debugging

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Data Handling
- All data processing occurs locally
- No external network connections required (except initial setup)
- Sensitive log data never leaves the local machine

### File System Access
- Application requires read access to log files
- Requires read access to GeoLite2 database
- Creates temporary files in system temp directory

### Network Security
- No inbound network connections
- No outbound connections during normal operation
- Electron security sandbox enabled

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### Single User Desktop Application
- Designed for individual security analyst use
- Not suitable for concurrent multi-user scenarios
- Consider server-based solution for team environments

### Performance Limits
- Recommended maximum log file size: 100MB
- Memory usage scales with data size
- CPU usage increases with complex filtering
